// PLANNING //

// What are you planning to write for your console.log? = I am going to write about the upcoming plans for the weekend about a friend named Jereon and his birthday celebration plans to go to a karaoke bar. His age is turning from 26 to 27 so I will use that for the changing number variable.

// What kind of types are you going to use and where? (using both number, string is requirement) = I'll use constant string variable of birthdayfriend for my friend's name that won't be changing throughout the story and will declare the let variable as a number for his age that will be changing from 26 to 27.

const BirthdayFriend = "Jereon"

let FriendsAge = "26"

console.log("This weekend, I plan to spend time with a big group of friends to celebrate the birthday of a close friend and former housemate, " +BirthdayFriend+ ", who is currently " +FriendsAge+ ". " +BirthdayFriend+ " has thoroughly enjoyed being " +FriendsAge+ ", and hoping to launch into his new age with a bunch of our friends.  First, I’ll meet up with other friends and " +BirthdayFriend+ " for predrinks with cheap beers at the Metropole downtown. After drinks, we’ll head to a karaoke bar called Funky Winkerbeans, where my friends and I sometimes hang out, for the janky vibes and good times.");

FriendsAge = "27"

console.log("Our friend " +BirthdayFriend+ " is a bit nervous about turning " +FriendsAge+ ", since it will mean he is getting closer to his thirties. " +FriendsAge+ " is not even that old, but he is understandably getting in his head about getting older and never having had a girlfriend. We will be there to support "+BirthdayFriend+" in his feels about our aging bodies, and maybe we can talk him through in realizing that he is a great person and friend, meaning that his self worth should not be based on the number of past girlfriends, nor his new age of " +FriendsAge+ ".");

// Looks good but not sure if he wants a let variable that is also a string aside from a number. example: let food = "cake"
// Also add a new console.log to split messages example: console.log("----------2nd Story"-----------)
